## **Software Development LifeCycle**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured, seven-phase methodology used to design, develop, and test high-quality software. 
It provides a step-by-step framework to ensure that the final product is functional, reliable, and meets user needs.


### The Seven Phases of SDLC

The process transitions from initial concepts to long-term software health:

- **Planning**: Developers set goals, define the software's purpose, and identify target customers. This phase includes estimating costs, planning resources (infrastructure and personnel), and identifying risks with stakeholders.

- **Analysis**: This involves gathering and documenting exactly what users want and need from the software. Developers identify all essential resources required, including hardware and specific applications.

- **Design**: A detailed blueprint is created to outline how the software will look and function. This includes designing the database structure and determining how to integrate external services like email or SMS.

- **Development**: The "magic happens" as developers write the actual code based on the blueprint. During this phase, they also ensure the software can integrate with databases and files.

- **Testing**: Before release, different parts of the software are tried out to ensure they perform exactly as expected. This step is critical to verify that the application "stays together" and functions smoothly.

- **Deployment**: The finished software is made accessible and operational for the target audience to use.

- **Maintenance**: Software requires regular updates and repairs after launch. This phase involves fixing bugs, making adjustments for changing requirements, and adding new features to enhance the user experience.

### Core Principles

The SDLC emphasizes that building software requires the same fundamental approach as any complex construction project: planning, building, testing, and fixing. Success in these phases relies on a combination of creativity, meticulous attention to detail, and a dedication to seeing a project through its entire lifecycle.

## Activity: A simple Java program

This [lab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-software-development/ungradedLab/sYmus/activity-a-simple-java-program) shows the basic set up and initialization for a Java project using IntelliJ IDEA. 

Suggested steps:

- Launch IntelliJ on your machine

- Create a New Project

- Create a new Java Class

- Add the new main Method

- Create a print statement

- Run the program

The main method is the classic long-standing, mandatory entry point required a specific signature for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute a standalone program. The lab example uses the syntax for traditional Java (v8-20)

```Java
public class MyFirstProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("I'm a Programmer!");
    }
}
```

This syntax requires the following elements:

- `public`: To be accessible from the external JVM process.

- `static`: To be called without an instance of the class.

- `void`: Indicating no value is returned to the JVM.

- `String[] args`: An array to accept command-line arguments.

Recent Java versions (21+) aim to reduce boilerplate code and make the language easier for beginners. The `main` method is now much more flexible and can be written with fewer modifiers, or even without an explicit class declaration in a "compact source file" (or "unnamed class").

The modern syntax allows for the following variations:

- **Instance main method (non-static)**

The `static` keyword isn't longer needed, as the JVM will automatically create an incetance of the class to run the method.

```Java
class MyFirstProgram {
    void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("I'm a Programmer!");
    }
}
```

- **No `main` parameters**

If the program doesn't need command-line arguments, the `String[] args` parameter can be omitted

```Java
class MyFirstProgram {
    void main() {
        System.out.println("I'm a Programmer!");
    }
}
```

- **Compact Source Files (Unnamed Class)**

For the most minimal approach, you can place code directly in a file without an explicit class declaration. The compiler automatically wraps it in a hidden class. 

```Java
// No class declaration needed
void main() {
    System.out.println("I'm a Programmer!");
}
```

**Evidence**: [MyFirstProgram.java](./MyFirstProgram.java)
